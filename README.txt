1006 Flask Project
In this project, I had a python file that will run 3 seperate pages: index.html, plan.html, and music.html
In index.html: This served as the home page where a picture of myself and information are as well as link to my 
favorite website(Still Processing podcast), and links the other two html files
In plan.html: In this file, there is a a description of my plans for my summer 
In music.html: There is information about my top 5 favorite songs right now
